# Battlestation Dotfiles Configuration

## Introduction
I use [dotfiles](https://github.com/simonfontana/dotfiles) project for all my Linux desktops.
Some configuration is specific to the desktop environment, and so I can not have this configuration part of my main dotfiles repository.
This is my battlestation environment configuration (personal desktop computer).
