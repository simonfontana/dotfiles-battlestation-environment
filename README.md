# Battlestation Dotfiles Configuration

## Introduction
I use [dotfiles](https://github.com/simonfontana/dotfiles) project for all my Linux desktops.
Some configuration is specific to the desktop environment, and so I can not have this configuration part of my main dotfiles repository.
This is my battlestation environment configuration (personal desktop computer).

## Usage
1. Clone [dotfiles](https://github.com/simonfontana/dotfiles) as your home directory.
2. Clone this project into _~/.config/dotfiles-environment/_ directory: <br>
   `git clone git@github.com:simonfontana/dotfiles-battlestation-environment.git ~/.config/dotfiles-environment/`
